# Whole Home High Speed Treasure Hunt

Our teenage daughter has been obsessed with PEAK, the video game. Needed a high-speed treasure hunt that bounced from one end of the house back and forth, with objectives that had to be done in the proper order, with bonus time items and surprise penalty explosive distraction items. Use a "Floor is Lava" style page theme, but really it is a PEAK Lava Kiln Theme.

The treasure hunt is set up by placing hidden notes with 3-digit codes in strategic places throughout the house. The treasures, bonus items, and penalty items can be disguised, however, to fit the theme. The hunt can have as many or as few treasures as desired. The length of time can also be adjusted. Edit the hunt/app.js to reflect the treasures/bonus/penalty codes and hints as needed.  If you decide to change the time from 5 minutes, you will also want to update the text in the Into page as well.

Finally, upload the code to any very basic web hosting service that can be accessed via the phone being used in the treasure hunt. Then navigate to the introduction on the phone, and begin the treasure hunt.

Good luck.
